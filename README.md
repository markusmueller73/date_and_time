# Date_And_Time
is a small library for rudimentary date and time calculations.

The date calculation works bevore the Linux epoch time (01. Jan 1970). The time calculations
are not reduced to the (clock) time, you can calc in addition to the default 24h clock.

For the Date and the Time are two seperate easy structures (see below).

Suggestions are welcome.

## Usage:
Only import the library: ```use date_and_time::*;```.
